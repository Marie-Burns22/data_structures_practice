## Purpose
These files are to practice algorithms for different structures.

## How to run
In VS Code open the file and uncomment the appropriate lines to run a specific function. Add any additional variables to run more tests. Use the Debug Console (in the same pane as the integrated TERMINAL) and select the debug sidebar from the left of the screen. From here you can run the code. Note: to see the return values in the debug console, you must wrap your function calls in console.log().
