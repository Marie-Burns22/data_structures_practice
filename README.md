## Purpose
These files are to practice algorithms for different structures.

## How to run
#### VS Code Debugger
In VS Code open the file your want to run and uncomment the appropriate lines to run a specific function. Add any additional variables to run more tests. Use the Debug Console (in the same pane as the integrated TERMINAL) and select the debug sidebar from the left of the screen. From here you can run the code. Note: to see the return values in the debug console, you must wrap your function calls in console.log().

#### Live Server
1. Open the index.html file.
2. Each JS file is linked in a script tag. Uncomment out the script tag for the 3. JS file you want to work with. 
4. Open the live server.
5. Open the dev tools and look for the output in the console.
